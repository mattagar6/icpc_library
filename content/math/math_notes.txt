Math Notes:

	i * x % m takes on m / gcd(x, m) different values in a cycle over all 0 <= i

Fractions:
	
	if a/b is in simplest terms, then the simplest terms for k + (a/b) is
			(k*b + a) / b, since gcd(a,b) == 1, by definition
			
	Continued fractions:
		- See this problem/editorial:

			- Editorial: https://dmoj.ca/problem/dmopc19c7p4/editorial
			- Can use matrices to simulate the process of "concatenating" continued fractions together
			  (2x2 matrix to maintain numerator, denominator of fraction)
